# Insight 

Geographic Disparity in Call Volumes:
Washington emerged as the highest-performing location with a total call duration of 27,861 minutes, significantly outpacing Dallas, which recorded the lowest duration at 10,809 minutes. This represents a 157.8% differential between the top and bottom performers, underscoring a substantial operational or demand gap between these regions.

Dominance of Washington in Total Contribution:
Washington accounted for 33.9% of aggregate call duration, highlighting its disproportionate impact on overall metrics. This suggests either higher customer engagement, larger market presence, or potential resource allocation disparities compared to other locations.

Channel Performance Variability:
Across the four communication channels analyzed, total call duration exhibited a wide range, spanning 164,547 to 266,466 minutes. This variance points to potential imbalances in channel utilization, effectiveness, or customer preference, warranting further investigation into channel-specific strategies.
